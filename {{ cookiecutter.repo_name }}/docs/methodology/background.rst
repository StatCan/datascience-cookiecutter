Background
==========

Identify relevant background information to the project.

* What is the "parent" production process of the proposed methodology (inference
  procedure)?
* Describe an inference problem that the proposed methodology is supposed to
  solve, within the context of its parent production process.
* What is the target population for which/whom inference is made?
* What inference is being made for (units in) the target population? Or, what is
  the precise use case for the proposed inference procedure within the context of
  its parent production process.
* How will these inferential outcomes be used?

  * For example, within the context of the parent production process, what action
    will be taken, or decision made, based on the outcomes of the inference?
